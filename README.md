ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of Machine Learning.

It contains 150 samples of iris flowers.

Each sample has 4 features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

There are 3 classes (species) of iris flowers:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

ðŸ¤– Model & Algorithm

For this project, we applied Logistic Regression to classify the iris flowers based on the given features.

ðŸŽ¯ Results

The model achieved an accuracy of ~100%.

Confusion Matrix and classification report confirm that the model performs well across all three classes.

âœ… Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be applied to simple datasets like Iris.
Our model achieved high accuracy in predicting the flower species.
Such classification models can be further extended to real-world applications in agriculture and botany.
